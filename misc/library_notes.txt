numpy is a language extension that defines the numerical array and matrix type and basic operations on them. 
scipy is another language extension that uses numpy to do advanced math, signal processing, optimization, statistics and much more. 
matplotlib is a language extension to facilitate plotting. 

#Ruby
has a built in library which includes Matrix, Vector and allows you to do things like multple a matrix times a vecotr like m * n

# Creates a zero-filled square matrix
> m = Matrix.zero(10)
> v = Vector.elements((0...10).to_a, copy = true)
> m * v
=> Vector[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] 

# Dimension Checking
> bad_v = Vector.elements((0...12).to_a, copy = true)
> m * bad_v
