# Streaming Authenticated Data Structure

 Data Structures
 - Random Matrices L & R  
 - Table of leaf values
 - Table of node labels
 - Public/Secret Key

 Operations
 - "Add element to Merkle tree"
 - "Remove element from Merkle Tree" (?)
 - "Boolean (non)-membership test"

QUESTION: For a membership (or other type of) test, does the Merkle Tree data structure provide the proof
	i.e. does it store the table of labels
	or is it table of labels part of some server-side of this library

	So, do we have a data structure that is used by some server side code,
	or are they neccessarily one entity?
